Casco insurance / car service (ADT: priority line, big integer).
 
Process 1. The customer insures the machine with casco insurance 
in a company that has a cooperation agreement with a car repair shop.
In this case, the deductible (the minimum fee to be paid by the customer 
in the event of an accident, which he has to pay himself) is A (LTL), 
of which A1 goes to the service due to the cooperation agreement as an appendix, 
and the customer is considered a VIP customer.
Such customers have priority service and their cars are handled first
(if necessary, even working overtime - the VIP customer's car must be serviced from delivery
moment continuously until it is settled, in one day).
Employees are payed double for overtime
 
Process 2. The client insures with simple casco insurance with a franchise of B litas (B = A-A1)
and the service does not receive extra money for it, but there is no need to work overtime, which costs more.

Program indicates what business logic is most beneficial to the service: 
to have as many cooperation agreements as possible, or to work without them at all.
 
Model parameters: mentioned values ​​A, Al and B. Also: U - hourly salary of a service employee, K - number of employees.
Other values ​​to be used: T1 - probability in percentage that the machine will be delivered by a VIP customer,
T2 is the percentage probability that the machine will be delivered by an ordinary customer,
TR is a random variable in hours required for one worker to tidy up the delivered machine (assume that 1 <= TR <= 5 * K).
